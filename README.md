## 🔍 **How It Works**

Chop uses the browser’s **Canvas API** to process and analyze images entirely on the client side:

1. 🧾 **Image Upload** → User selects an image file.  
2. ✂️ **Image Processing** → The app splits the image into defined segments.  
3. 🔤 **OCR Implementation** → Built-in OCR recognizes and extracts text from each segment.  
4. 💾 **Output Generation** → Results can be downloaded (split images + recognized text).
